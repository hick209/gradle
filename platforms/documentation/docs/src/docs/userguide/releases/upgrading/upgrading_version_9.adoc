[[upgrading_version_9]]

= Upgrading your build from Gradle 9.x to the latest

This chapter provides the information you need to migrate your Gradle 9.x builds to the latest Gradle release.
For migrating from Gradle 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, or 8.x see the <<upgrading_version_8.adoc#upgrading_version_8, older migration guide>> first.

We recommend the following steps for all users:

. Try running `gradle help --scan` and view the https://gradle.com/enterprise/releases/2018.4/#identify-usages-of-deprecated-gradle-functionality[deprecations view] of the generated Build Scan.
+

+
This lets you see any deprecation warnings that apply to your build.
+
Alternatively, you can run `gradle help --warning-mode=all` to see the deprecations in the console, though it may not report as much detailed information.
. Update your plugins.
+
Some plugins will break with this new version of Gradle because they use internal APIs that have been removed or changed.
The previous step will help you identify potential problems by issuing deprecation warnings when a plugin tries to use a deprecated part of the API.
+
. Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version {gradleVersion}` to update the project to {gradleVersion}.
. Try to run the project and debug any errors using the <<troubleshooting.adoc#troubleshooting, Troubleshooting Guide>>.

[[changes_9.1]]
== Upgrading from 9.0 and earlier

=== Deprecations

[[project_container_methods]]
=== Deprecated `Project.container(...)` methods

The link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#container-java.lang.Class-[`Project.container(...)`] methods are deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 10. These methods were used to manually create named domain object containers.

A named domain object container can be created with a <<properties_providers.adoc#mutable_managed_properties,managed property>>, which delegates the responsibility to Gradle to instantiate the container properly.

Since Gradle 5.5, `ObjectFactory.domainObjectContainer(...)` has provided equivalent functionality if the plugin cannot use a managed property.

Unlike `Project.container(Class)`, `ObjectFactory.domainObjectContainer(Class)` requires the given type is non-final and elements of the container will be decorated and made extension aware like all other Gradle instantiated objects.

=== Potential breaking changes
